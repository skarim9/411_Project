## Team 5

## Directory structure
Our final project is in `final-dotnet-react`, prototype is in `prototype`, and other assignments are in `docs`.

## Running
Run with `dotnet run` or `npm start` to run just the React SPA.

## Project description
Our first idea for the project uses the Deep Art API. The user can upload their own pictures or get album cover pictures from Spotify and use the Deep Art API to turn their image into a painting. The possibilities are endless for their picture choice and with the preconfigured styling options they can create impressive art work. After the Deep Art API transforms the user's picture into a work of art the web app allows the user to use that art image for any purpose they wish.

The APIs are listed below:

## Second Idea (the one we didn't do)
Our second idea for the project uses the TripAdvisor API and Google Tasks API for planning your next travel itinerary. This web app is the place for keeping track of your
travel plans and can even add new destinations into your itinerary using the Google Tasks API. It can also help with planning and will help calculate the best route or order of 
visiting your destinations for the day. For example, if you have 5 destinations planned for a day, we can use the Google Maps API and TripAdvisor API to get the shortest and most 
efficient combined route from your starting point through all 5 destinations. Additionally, the TripAdvisor app can alert users of nearby attractions at each destination. 
Furthermore, at each destination, the user can check off their destination using the Tasks API. Finally, there is a social element of sharing or editing friends' itineraries.

The APIs are listed below:

### Special Notes
There is also a txt file in docs which also contains these ideas.
